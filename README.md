## About the Application
Think Tiles is a intuitive web application designed to expand math education in digital spaces. My platform brings together the power of visual learning and interactive problem-solving, enabling educators to create engaging "think tiles" that foster a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts.

My web application enables teachers to save and organize their unique "think tiles" directly to their profiles. This feature facilitates easy access and promotes the reuse of meticulously designed workspaces, streamlining the lesson planning process and enhancing overall teaching efficiency.

## Key Features
* Create Think Tiles: Craft engaging "think tiles" with interactive math manipulative workspaces.
* Save and Organize: Store your curated collection of "think tiles" for quick and easy lesson planning.
* Interactive Learning: Foster student engagement and comprehension through visual and hands-on problem-solving.
* Effortless Reusability: Make the most of your meticulously designed materials for continuous teaching excellence.

## Key Dependencies
- **@emotion/react**: CSS-in-JS library for styling components.
- **@mui/material**: Material-UI's React component library.
- **axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for API requests.
- **react**: Core library for building user interfaces.
- **react-dnd**: Drag-and-drop library for interactive interfaces.
- **react-hook-form**: Form state management and validation.
- **react-scripts**: Configuration and scripts for React apps.

## How to Get Started
Follow these simple steps to dive into the world of Think Tiles:

Step 1: Clone this repository to your local machine.
Step 2: Set up the backend API using Spring Boot. [Think Tiles Back-end Repo](https://github.com/johanna-j-c/back-end-think-tiles)
Step 3: Implement the frontend using React and the React DnD library. See below for Create React App Setup.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
